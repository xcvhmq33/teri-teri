# Teri-teri Discord Bot

**Teri-teri** is a Discord bot that allows users to browse an in-game encyclopedia of items from [Houkai Gakuen 2](https://houkai2nd.miraheze.org/wiki/Houkai_Gakuen_2_Wiki) within Discord.

## Usage

1. **Search for an item**:  
   Use the `/search_item` command followed by the name or ID of the item you want to look up. The bot will search the database and provide you with detailed information about the item.

2. **Update an item**:  
   If an item has been updated in the game, or a new community translation is available, you can use the `/update_item` command to update the item interactively.

3. **Update all game data**:  
   Use `/update_data` to refresh all in-game data when there are updates in the game. This ensures that the bot has the most recent information.
